x2go_chef
=========

automated deployment of an x2go server

1. clone the repo
2. get aws api keys into the shell environment (todo : example)
3. run ./newserver.rb and wait :)

in the end, you'll have a new x2go server to which you can connect via x2go client. (currently the desktop is xfce as it seems to be the quickest install ?)

missing some validations of aws api keys existance in environment...
